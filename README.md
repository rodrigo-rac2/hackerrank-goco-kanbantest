## Functionality Requirements

- The component board contains 4 stages of tasks in sequence - 'Backlog', 'To Do', 'Ongoing' and 'Done'.

- An array of tasks is passed as a prop to the component.

- In every individual stage, the tasks are rendered as a list `<ul>` where each task is a single list item `<li>` which displays the name of the task.
    
- Each task list item has 2 icon buttons at the right -
    1. Back button - This moves the task to the previous stage in sequence, if any. This button is disabled if the task is in the first stage.
    2. Forward button - This moves the task to the next stage in sequence, if any. This button is disabled if the task is in the last stage.

- Each task has 2 properties -
    1. name - name of task. This is the unique identification for every task. [STRING] 
    2. stage - stage of task [NUMBER] (0 represents Backlog stage, 1 represents To Do stage, 2 represents Ongoing stage, 3 represents Done stage).


## Testing Requirements

- `<ul>` for 'Backlog' stage should have the data-test-id attribute 'stage-0'.
- `<ul>` for 'To Do' stage should have the data-test-id attribute 'stage-1'.
- `<ul>` for 'Ongoing' stage should have the data-test-id attribute 'stage-2'.
- `<ul>` for 'Done' stage should have the data-test-id attribute 'stage-3'.
- Every single `<li>` task should have below:
  1. The `<span>` containing the name should have data-test-id attribute 'TASK_NAME-name' where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by hyphen symbol. For example, for the task named "task 0", it should be 'task-0-name'. For the task named "abc", it should be 'abc-name'.
  2. The back button should have data-test-id attribute 'TASK_NAME-back' where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by hyphen symbol. For example, for the task named "task 0", it should be 'task-0-back'. For the task named "abc", it should be 'abc-back'.
  3. The forward button should have data-test-id attribute 'TASK_NAME-forward' where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by hyphen symbol. For example, for the task named "task 0", it should be 'task-0-forward'. For the task named "abc", it should be 'abc-forward'.
